# Predicting Student Academic Performance

This project uses data science and machine learning techniques to predict student academic performance based on behavioral, socio-economic, and demographic factors.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau
- CSV dataset (131 records, 20 features)

## Models Used
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Results
- The Random Forest model showed the highest accuracy.
- Key insights were visualized using Tableau dashboards.
